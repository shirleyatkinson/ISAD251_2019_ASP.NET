# ISAD251_2019_ASP.NET
My Repository for demonstrating ISAD251 database application development.  This page is my GitHub prototype page.  If this was a coursework submission then I would have links to a YouTube video, evidence of testing on more than one browser and finally evidence of web accessibility testing and results.  These will appear over time but are not yet complete. 

Welcome to the repository for demonstrating the sample application, the **Student Help In Tutorials** application.  This application is designed to allow students to register their request for help within a tutorial in SMB109 which then uses the smart lights to alert the lecturer of where a student is looking for support.

A link to a YouTube video of the application runnning will be provided here.

## Student Help In Tutorial Application
The requirements for this application are outlined in the attached application fact sheet.  The application has been written using ASP.NET and Microsoft Visual Studio, it uses the Philips Hue lights Developer RESTful API in SMB109.  

[Home page](https://github.com/shirleyatkinson/ISAD251_2019_ASP.NET/blob/master/docs/index.png) The application begins with the home page giving an outline of the purpose of the application.  The Request button and nav bar link lead to the Request page shown below.

[Request page](https://github.com/shirleyatkinson/ISAD251_2019_ASP.NET/blob/master/docs/Request.png) The Request page displays a selection of modules taken from the database.  One entering the data, the information is pass through to the stored procedure in the database ready to enter the request.  On successful completion of the request the lights in SMB109 will light up and indicate a colour specific to the seat. 

The [Application Fact Sheet](https://github.com/shirleyatkinson/ISAD251_2019_ASP.NET/blob/master/docs/ISAD251_Unit9_Application_Fact_Sheet_Planning.pdf) outlines the requirements and non-functional requirements for the application and how it is used.
